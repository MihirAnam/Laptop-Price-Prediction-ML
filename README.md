# Laptop-Price-Prediction-ML

Laptop Price Prediction(Machine Learning)

-In this Project , the data contains information about laptop features and price.
-Data is preprocessed and cleaned using Pandas and Numpy libraries.
-Implemented feature engineering as a means of creating new features using existing features.
-Created visualizations on the data using Matplotlib & Seaborn to get the insights from data. 
-Trained the data using Linear Regression, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, AdaboostRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor from which GradientBoostingRegressor gave the best r2score.
-Performed Hyper-Parameter-Tuning on GradientBoostingRegressor using GridSearchCV to tune the model.
